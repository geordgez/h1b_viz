# H1B Data Visualization

A few colleagues recently linked me to the [publicly available H1B database](http://h1bdata.info/) containing data from the US Department of Labor. The salary information published was especially interesting given that sites such as Glassdoor record such information through self-reported surveys; these may not always be accurate. Since the salaries here are fairly accurate and timestamped, I wanted to quickly make a tool that allows job-seekers to fairly evaluate their offers by aggregating H1B application information.

Although the information here is largely accurate, one of the caveats of the salary information is that H1B applications also carry fixed cost ($15,000) for employers which may be factored into ultimate salary offers. 

The site itself is useful but doesn't provide many tools to interact with and visualize the data automatically. Of course, one can always copy and paste the tables into Excel but that's not easily automated. The portion of the project will be in an iPython notebok and the second will likely be a bunch of visualization tools in JavaScript.
