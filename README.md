# H1B Data Visualization

A few colleagues recently linked me to the [publicly available H1B database](http://h1bdata.info/) containing data from the US Department of Labor. The salary information published was especially interesting given that sites such as Glassdoor record such information through self-reported surveys which may not always be accurate. Since the salaries here have both a timestamp and accurate number attached to them, I wanted to quickly make a tool that allows job-seekers to fairly evaluate their offers by aggregating H1B application information. The site itself is useful but doesn't provide too many tools to interact with and visualize the data.

One of the caveats of the salary information is that H1B applications also carry fixed cost ($15,000) for employers which may be factored into ultimate salary offers.
